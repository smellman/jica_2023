# What is tiled map?

---

# Tile technology

- Provide map image or data over the internet.
  - Map images are separated as tiles.
  - Zoom Level 0 = World
  - Each zoom level doubles in the dimensions.
  - Too many tiles use "Web Mercator" projection.

![bg right 80%](https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png)
https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png

---

# Useful to web

- Structure of tile is useful for web.
  - Enable to scroll map smoothly.
  - Enable to zoom up and zoom down map smoothly.
  - HTTP GET request.
- Tile become known for Google Maps.
  - Tile has existed from the late 1990s.

---

# Zoom

- Zoom level 0 : 1 file
- Zoom level 1 : 2 x 2 = 4 files
- Zoom level 2 : 4 x 4 = 16 files
- ...
- Zoom level 18 : 2^18 x 2^18 = 262,144 x 262,144 = 68,719,476,736 files

https://maps.gsi.go.jp/help/image/tileNum.png

---

# GET Request

- Many services use REST API(GET Request).
  - https://.../Z/X/Y.Format
  - Z: Zoom Level
  - X: X coordinate
  - Y: Y coordinate
  - Format: 
    - Raster image format(png, jpg, webp)
    - Vector data format(pbf, mvt)

---

# GET Request example

- https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/3/2/4.png
  - Zoom = 3, X = 2, Y = 4, format = png
  - X and Y coordinates start with 0.

![bg right 90%](./images/1_get_request_example.png)

---

# Specification

- Two tile service specifications are popular.
  - Tile Map Service(TMS)
  - Web Map Tile Service(WMTS)
- TMS is simpler than WMTS.
- TMS's X Y coordinate is started from bottom left.
  - Same as Cartesian coordinate system.
- WMTS's X Y coordinate is started from top left.
  - Same as Coordinate system of 2D computer graphics.

---

![bg 90%](./images/2_tms_wmts.png)

---

# The Y coordinate flipped

- OpenStreetMap use TMS like protocol but Y coordinate is numbered from top.
  - OpenStreetMap call "Slippy Map".
  - We call xyz tile.
    - {z}/{x}/{y}.png
    - Also we call zxy tile.

---

# XYZ tile

- De facto standard of tiled map.
  - Web Mercator projection
  - Y coordinate flipped TMS
  - Provide REST API
    - {z}/{x}/{y}.{format}
  - Anyone provide "Specification"
- Too many libraries support XYZ tile.
  - Leaflet, OpenLayers, Maplibre GL JS, Google Maps API etc.

# How to design your own tiled map

---

# Design tiled map

- Vector tile doesn't have a style.
  - The client renders images with style settings.
- In this presentation, we use `charites` to design tiled map.
  - Charites convert Style Specification(JSON) to YAML.
  - YAML is easy to read and write for human.
  - YAML is easy to edit for beginners.

---

# Try to edit style

```bash
cd ~/jica_scripts/vector_tile
make practice
```
Open http://<your host>.local:8080/ in your browser.

Open other terminal and run following command.

```bash
cd ~/jica_scripts/vector_tile
nano style-practice.yml
```

---

# nano

- nano is a simple text editor.
  - nano is easy to use for begineer.
- Ctrl + O: Save file
- Ctrl + X: Exit nano

![bg right 50%](./images/17_nano.png)

# Remove comments on layers

Remove comments in style-practice.yml.

```yaml

# Fill layer

```yaml

# Line layer

- Draw line with polyline features.
  - Normal line.
  - Dash-array line.
    - Following example is Normal line + Dash-array line.
  
![](./images/21_dash-array.png)

---

# Filter

roadl-primary.yml and roadl-secondary.yml use filter.

roadl-primary.yml use following filter.

```yaml
filter:
  - all
  - - '=='
    - rtt
    - '14'
```

'rtt' is a field name in roadl layer and '14' is primary route.

---

# Zoom function

- Zoom function is useful to change style dynamically.
  - Set Zoom 6 to 1 and Zoom 10 to 6, the value will increase between Zoom 6 and 10.
- "base" property will use to control the rate which the function output increases.
  - "base = 1" will be increased linearly.

# icon-image and text-field

- icon-image is a property of symbol layer.
  - icon-image is a name of icon.
    - icon-image is defined in sprite.
- text-field is a property of symbol layer.
  - text-field is a name of field in source data.
    - It can use Feature Properties using {field_name}.

# text-offset

- text-offset is a property of symbol layer.
  - text-offset is a offset of text.
    - It can use array of [x, y].
    - x and y are offset from center of point.

# How to distribute your own tiled map

# Raster tile hosting (1)

- If you use small number of data only, hosting as static image is easy.
  - Use nginx or Apache HTTP Server.
  - Use AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
  - Github Pages is good for small data and free.
    - Be careful to license of tile images.

https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages

---

# Raster tile hosting (2)

- If you use large number of data, be careful to hosting.
  - File system limitation: max number of files.
    - Ext4 on Linux: 4,294,967,295 files(specified at filesystem creation time)
  - File copy will take a long time.
  - MBTiles is a solution to hosting large number of data.
    - MBUtil is useful to create .mbtiles from tile images.

```bash
mb-util temp/ el.mbtiles 
```

---

# Vector tile hosting - tileserver-gl

- Tileserver GL is useful.
  - But vector tiles needs SSL access in internet.
  - Let's encrypt is useful to get SSL certificate.
    - https://letsencrypt.org/
  - Setup frontend server(Apache/nginx/etc) and connect from server with reverse proxy.
