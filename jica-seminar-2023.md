# What is tiled map?

---

# Tile technology

- Provide map image or data over the internet.
  - Map images are separated as tiles.
  - Zoom Level 0 = World
  - Each zoom level doubles in the dimensions.
  - Too many tiles use "Web Mercator" projection.

![bg right 80%](https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png)
https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png

---

# Useful to web

- Structure of tile is useful for web.
  - Enable to scroll map smoothly.
  - Enable to zoom up and zoom down map smoothly.
  - HTTP GET request.
- Tile become known for Google Maps.
  - Tile has existed from the late 1990s.

---

# Zoom

- Zoom level 0 : 1 file
- Zoom level 1 : 2 x 2 = 4 files
- Zoom level 2 : 4 x 4 = 16 files
- ...
- Zoom level 18 : 2^18 x 2^18 = 262,144 x 262,144 = 68,719,476,736 files

![bg right 90%](https://maps.gsi.go.jp/help/image/tileNum.png)
https://maps.gsi.go.jp/help/image/tileNum.png

---

# GET Request

- Many services use REST API(GET Request).
  - https://.../Z/X/Y.Format
  - Z: Zoom Level
  - X: X coordinate
  - Y: Y coordinate
  - Format: 
    - Raster image format(png, jpg, webp)
    - Vector data format(pbf, mvt)

---

# GET Request example

- https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/3/2/4.png
  - Zoom = 3, X = 2, Y = 4, format = png
  - X and Y coordinates start with 0.

![bg right 90%](./images/1_get_request_example.png)

---

# Specification

- Two tile service specifications are popular.
  - Tile Map Service(TMS)
  - Web Map Tile Service(WMTS)
- TMS is simpler than WMTS.
- TMS's X Y coordinate is started from bottom left.
  - Same as Cartesian coordinate system.
- WMTS's X Y coordinate is started from top left.
  - Same as Coordinate system of 2D computer graphics.

---

![bg 90%](./images/2_tms_wmts.png)

---

# The Y coordinate flipped

- OpenStreetMap use TMS like protocol but Y coordinate is numbered from top.
  - OpenStreetMap call "Slippy Map".
  - We call xyz tile.
    - {z}/{x}/{y}.png
    - Also we call zxy tile.

https://maps.gsi.go.jp/help/image/tileNum.png

---

# XYZ tile

- De facto standard of tiled map.
  - Web Mercator projection
  - Y coordinate flipped TMS
  - Provide REST API
    - {z}/{x}/{y}.{format}
  - Anyone provide "Specification"
- Too many libraries support XYZ tile.
  - Leaflet, OpenLayers, Maplibre GL JS, Google Maps API etc.

---

# Raster tile (1/3)

- Provides "rendered image"
  - The image doesn't have any "data".
  - Focus to visualization.

![bg right 90%](./images/3_openstreetmap.png)

---

# Raster tile (2/3)

- Provides "Satellite images" or "Aerial photograph"
  - Focus to photography.
  - The image doesn't have any "data" too.

![bg right 90%](./images/4_gsi_map_1.png)

---

# Raster tile (3/3)

- Provides "data" as image.
  - Focus to data.
    - Population, Temperature, Rainfall, Elevation, etc.
  - The image has "data" as color.
    - Sample raster tiles contain the elevation value obtainable by calculating with RGB values.

![bg right 90%](./images/5_gsi_map_2.png)

---

# Vector tile (1/2)

- Provides "Vector data"
  - Each tile contains "Vector data".
    - The tile like a data container.

![bg right 90%](./images/6_vector_tile_example.png)

---

# Vector tile (2/2)

- Vector tile doesn't have a style.
  - The client renders images with style settings.
    - Easy to rotation and bearing.
    - Supports 3D rendering.
- Programmable.
  - The client can change the style dynamically.

---

# Vector tile example - Multilingual

# How to create your own tiled map

---

# Raster tile processing pattern 1: Global map (One GeoTIFF file)

- Download GeoTIFF file from Global Map archive.
- Enable transparency.
- Convert GeoTIFF to XYZ tile using gdal2tiles.

![height:300px](./images/10_gdal2tiles.png)

---

# How to process

```bash
cd ~/jica_scripts/raster_tile_gm
make fetch # Download GeoTIFF file from Global Map archive.
make transparent # Enable transparency.
make generate_tile # Convert GeoTIFF to XYZ tile using gdal2tiles.
make serve # run nginx
```

---

# How to read Makefile

```Makefile
fetch:
        git clone https://github.com/globalmaps/gmlk10.git

transparent:
        gdalbuildvrt -srcnodata "0 0 99" el.vrt gmlk10/el.tif

generate_tile:
        gdal_translate -of vrt -expand rgba el.vrt temp.vrt
        gdal2tiles.py --xyz -s EPSG:4326 -z 0-11 temp.vrt

serve:
        docker run -p 8080:80 -v $(PWD)/temp:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx
```

Makefile is simple to run tasks.
